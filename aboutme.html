        <h2>Why Do We Love Shoes?</h2>
        <br>
        <hr>
           <p>
          They wait in long lines in the bitter cold. They squeal with delight over the stitch on the shoes or the faux snakeskin
          upper. Colors more likely to be seen during Carnival in Rio than on any self-conscious American are hits. Catty quips 
          about style choices are met with irrational exuberance over over-hyped new designs.
          No, these aren’t the insufferable Carrie wannabes taking up New York’s sidewalks—they are teenage boys and grown men
           all over the world going on about basketball sneakers.In terms of American contributions to global style and comfort,
            the basketball sneaker has to rank up there with the T-shirt and riveted jeans. And as can be seen in any mall or 
            casual glance around the subway, the sneakers left the court long ago.
           Today, sneakers are a hugely lucrative juggernaut. In 2012, for instance, Nike’s line of LeBron James sneakers
            generated $300 million—in the U.S alone. Apparently everybody still wants to be like Mike—so much so that kids 
            get shot over pairs of his namesake sneakers. And the footwear’s infiltration of the fashion world is pretty much
             complete.In his new book Slam Kicks: Basketball Sneakers that Changed the Game, published by Rizzoli this week,
              Slam Magazine editor Ben Osborne sketches the vivid and passion-filled history of the sneaker. Osborne takes us
               back to 1917 and the Converse Rubber Shoe Company in Massachusetts, and the company’s iconic hi-top All Stars.
             With the All Stars, Osborne also introduces the two significant themes that underpin not only his book, but the
              wearing of basketball sneakers to the present day.
             The first is the move to assign the naming of shoes to a specific, recognizable person. In this earliest case it
              was Chuck Taylor in 1921, four years after the shoes were released, who played for the brand’s semi-pro All Star
               team. Taylor offered his two cents for some changes to the shoe, and in turn Converse named the shoes for him, 
               and placed his now iconic signature on the side.
             This trend may seem unsurprising to us today, accustomed as we are to celebrity branding for everything from 
             perfumes, to impotence medication, to food. But more than almost any other consumer durable, the success of a
              basketball shoe is commensurate to the star wattage of who is wearing the kicks. Part of this is unique to
               basketball. Soccer may be the biggest sport in the world, but even if you idolize Ronaldo, you can’t exactly
                wear his cleats to class or the club. On the other hand, in basketball you can not only wear what your idol
                 is wearing—you can look good in them. ETC...
